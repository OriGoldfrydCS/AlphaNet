# AtoZ (Image to Text)

**AtoZ** is an end-to-end pipeline that takes images containing text and outputs a textual representation of that content. The project is divided into six stages, each responsible for a specific part of the image-to-text process, and orchestrated by a single `main_pipeline.py` script.

## Overview

AtoZ is designed to **convert images into accurate text** by breaking down the recognition task into multiple stages:

1. **Segmenting images into words**  
2. **Extracting characters from these words**  
3. **Classifying each character**  
4. **Converting those classifications into text**  
5. **Correcting the recognized text** using a Large Language Model (LLM)  
6. **Outputting** the final result

This modular approach makes it easy to replace or improve individual components without affecting the rest of the pipeline.

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Character Segmentation
- **File/Module**: `stage_1`
- **Purpose**: Takes the Sentence images and breakes them to single words, and then to a single charchters for the next stage.

### Stage 2: Character Classification
- **File/Module**: `stage_2`
- **Purpose**: Classifies each character image (from Stage 1) and maps it to the corresponding textual character.

### Stage 3: Vector-to-Text
- **File/Module**: `stage_3`
- **Purpose**: Converts the classification outputs (which may be in vector/label format) into text strings.

### Stage 4: Correction Module
- **File/Module**: `stage_4`
- **Purpose**: Refines and corrects the recognized text using a Large Language Model (LLM) to ensure higher accuracy and resolve ambiguities.

### Stage 5: Output Module
- **File/Module**: `stage_5`
- **Purpose**: Finalizes the text (e.g., formatting, post-processing) and provides it as output (console, file, or other desired format).
